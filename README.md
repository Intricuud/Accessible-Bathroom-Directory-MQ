# Accessible Bathroom Directory MQ
Author: Intarawat Thanundornwat & Hayley Sparkl

## Ideas
This project was originally an idea of Hayley who have accessible needs and figure that making this app would fill a hold in the market. <br/>

## Purposes
The purpose of this application is to help those with accessible needs find the right bathroom that cater to their needs, one example is auto or manual door? that's the problem we are trying to solve by providing other option so students and staffs know immediately which bathroom to go to.
